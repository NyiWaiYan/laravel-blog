        Hi, everyone! Welcome to my blog! My name is NYI WAI YAN and I am the current Grad student of NCC. I came from Burma and have been working in ---  for 2 years. At the age of 20, I have started my journey from a Junior Devloper to Senior Developer.  Being an senior developer made me independent and learned to understand the leading role in my own way. Overall, Life in a foreign country made me grow fast and leaves a lot of unforgettable memory to me. I am so excited to share with you MORE of what my blog has to offer! The amount of ideas, how-toâ€™s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out. I wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog and what you will be seeing more of in my future posts.
